## Snippets
In the folder sninppets you find snippets for the Sublime Text Editor. 
When included you can just type "com", hit tab and end up with "<expan orig="9">com</expan>"

### Download the editor
You find the editor here:
https://www.sublimetext.com/

### Downloading and installing snippets
Then download the snippets dir. And unzip it in your Packages dir. Here's some help for finding that: https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/how-to-find-snippet-location/34691
If you need help with that, please just ask on twitter @petermarteau

###Usage###
General usage is you type the unabbreviated form and hit tab, i.e.
com<tab> results in <expan orig="9">com</expan>
  
I'll make a list later, but the filenames are pretty selfexplanatory

### Snippets in Sublime
If you want to do something like these yourself for other projects, here are the docs:
